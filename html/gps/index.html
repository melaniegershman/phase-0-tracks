		<h2>MAIN:</h2>
		<p><em>Main must not be a descendent of an article, aside, footer, header, or nav element.
		Only one main element can be used per document.
		The main content area consists of content that is directly related to, or expands upon the central topic of a document or the central functionality of an application. This content should be unique to the document, excluding any content that is repeated across a set of documents such as sidebars, navigation links, copyright information, site logos, and search forms (unless the document's main function is as a search form).</em></p>
		<section>
			<h2>SECTION:</h2>
			<p><em>The section tag defines sections in a document, such as chapters, headers, footers, or any other sections of the document.</em></p>
		</section>
		<article>
			<h2>ARTICLE:</h2>
			<p><em>An element that lives on its own; a self-contained composition such as a forum post, magazine, blog entry, etc.</em></p>
		</article>

			<li>What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?</li>
				<ul>
					<li>The purpose of HTML5 semantic tags is to provide standarization for developers. I think items like section, nav, header, and footer are really helpful for laying out the various elements of your site.</li>
				</ul>
			<li>What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?</li>
				<ul>
					<li>The browser renders the elements in your HTML as it reads down your code, so that the elements are displayed in the order that they have been written in.</li>
				</ul>
			<li>What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? </li>
				<ul>
					<li>I learned how powerful Sublime is as a developer tool. I am really excited about using snippets to make useful boilerplate code.</li>
				</ul>
			<li>What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?</li> 
				<ul>
					<li>I am still trying to full grasp the usage of elements such as section and article, and how they can interact with each other within my code. I'm learning more about it by inspecting other websites and reading additional documentation.</li>
