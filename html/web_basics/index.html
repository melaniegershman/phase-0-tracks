		<h1><strong>THE CHINCHILLA</strong></h1>
		<p>I'll be honest with you, I barely know what a chinchilla is. Is it a rat? Is it a squirrel? Is it a pokemon?</p>
		<p><em>IDK.</em></p>
		<p>What I do know, is this:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Chinchillas are fuzzy.</li>
			<li>I want one.</li>
			<li>They hold things:</li>

		</ul>
		<p>I guess if you want some real facts, you can click <a href="http://chinchillacare.org/">here</a>; however I've summed some important information below.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Chinchillas hail from Chile, Peru, Argentina, and Bolivia.</li>
			<li>Chinchillas live in herds that range from 14 members (cute) to 100 members (can you imagine?!!!!?).</li>
			<li>Chinchillas can jump up to 6 ft (hide your snacks!).</li>
			<li>Speaking of snacks, they eat plant leaves, fruits, seeds, and small insects.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>I hope you've enjoyed learning about these furry little friends!</p>
