# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control allows us to view the entire history of revisions to one or more files. It is useful because you can keep your program safe while you make changes to a file. 
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a copy of a program that you can work on without affecting the "master" code. You can merge your branch into the master branch once it is working the way you want. A branch is useful because you can work separately on it without affecting the workflow of other people that are working on the same project.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message? 
A commit records changes to a repository with a descriptive message. A good commit message will describe the change that has been made. 
* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict occurs when, for example, two lines of code are modified by two different people, or if one line is deleted while the same line in another branch is kept. If this happens, Git doesn't know which branch to use and will raise a conflict that will need to be resolved.
