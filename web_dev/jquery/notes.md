#jQuery Self-Study
----
## Plan of Action:

* Gather a group of students
* Assign different portions of study to each (or study entire topic separately)
* Spend 15 minutes getting a general idea of what jQuery is/what it is used for
* Spend an hour and fifteen minutes studying either assigned portions or whatever resources we find useful
	* jQuery Functions and Syntax
	* Dynamic HTML
	* jQuery Events
	* jQuery Effects
* Spend 10 minutes each explaining what we learned, including pertinent vocabulary and concepts 

Release 2:

My team and I studied in 3 25 minute blocks, with 5 minute breaks in between. It was helpful to take breaks to briefly chat over each other's progress or to otherwise clarify anything we found immediately confusing. When we finished our self-study, we each discussed the various rabbit holes that we had let ourselves get into, which led to more broad conversations about each person's topic. It was also really helpful to recap with a team because each person wound up  studying a completely different topic. One person used his time to use a jQuery effect on a picture, another delved deeper into the DOM and jQuery selectors, and I read about different events and effects. Together, we were able to teach each other a new topic, and better understand what we had taught ourselves.
