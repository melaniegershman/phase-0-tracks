# Hello, welcome to MasterIt!

## What is MasterIt?
----
MasterIt was inspired by [Malcolm Gladwell's](https://www.amazon.com/Outliers-Story-Success-Malcolm-Gladwell/dp/0316017930) idea that it takes 10,000 hours to master a skill. MasterIt keeps track of all of the skills you have in progress and then records and tallies up any activities you've done to in order to achieve mastery of a skill. 

Whether you've entered in an update to an ongoing goal, or you're starting from scratch with a brand new skill, MasterIt will always print out a list of your ongoing skills, and an activity log that details all the things you've done to make progress of the skill you've updated most recently.
